        </h1>
        <p>
          Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
          improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
          designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
          stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
          something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
          designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
          really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
          something nice and did not solve any problem.

              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
              finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.

            It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you,

            something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close

          <p>
            It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these

            start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

          <p>
            How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
            features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget
            to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
